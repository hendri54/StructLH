Given a vector of mutable structs, compute a function of all numeric fields.
Immutable structs are skipped.

Example use case: Compute the mean and standard deviation of simulated model statistics.

`reduceFct` takes a vector of numeric inputs and returns a single numeric output that is of compatible size and type so it can be written back into an instance of the objects contained in `oVecV`.

To handle `Nan` or `missing`, make sure that `reduceFct` appropriately handles or skips them.

Optional input `fieldTypes` indicates which non-numeric field types to use as well.

This relies on `propertynames` to identify the fields to operate on. It uses `getproperty` and `setproperty!` to set those fields. These need to be appropriately overloaded for user defined types that do not store the properties "directly" (as accessed by `getfield`).

Limitation: Because the output object is of the same type as the input objects in `oVecV`, it is not possible to apply `reduceFct` that returns a different type from its inputs. For example, `mean` of integers does not work.

Change: exclude immutable fields, but keep scalars (which are immutable but can be changed!) +++
